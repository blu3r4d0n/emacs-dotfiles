#+TITLE: blu3r4d0n's (Philip) Emacs
* This is currently a WIP
I recently switched from VIM to emacs, and am very pleased so far. The extensibilty of emacs and elisp is mind blowing to me

** Startup file
- The startup file is emacs, I plan to move these commands into my .config/emacs in the future
**  wm.el
- The wm.el file runs EXWM which makes emacs into a window manager.
- It also detects wether or not I have an external monitor connected and runs xrandr to configure respectively. 
** Future Plans
- I plan to integrate my git workflow into emacs
- I'm trying to build up to using emacs as an IDE
- Use org mode as my agenda
- Besides coding I like to write and I feel I could turn Emacs into a good word processor given enough tweaking.
- I also am learning the default keybindings because my goal is to eventually uninstall evil mode.
